I don't think that's a thing. are you confusing the sight of a food you dislike, with the smell of it ? or is this the world's most non sense homophobia test ? I hope it's the first one. I don't want to believe anyone understands so little about the way people behave or how psychology works, that anyone literally is so stupid they actually think that disliking eggplants would be a sign of homophobia. it sounds like a joke on it's always sunny in philadelphia, sam. please, please tell me this is something you're laughing about in your free time thinking that you're tricking Hayley into believing the worst psychology anyone ever heard. you are not. they have noticed how insanely out of character you started acting that's why they are here. they have been rolling their eyes in their head every time you come up with crap like this and actually open your mouth and suggest it. it is just so absurd

I feel that you would haunt me sam. I feel like in your world view I took hayley away from you. you are not entitled to Hayley wanting to hangout with you over anyone else, that is all about you and Hayley, nothing to do with me. you are mad at the wrong person. this whole insane thing you did, is comparable to someone getting cheated on, then getting back with the person who cheated on them and talking shit about the person they cheated with....with the person who cheated on them

also finally i just wanna point out how hilarious it is that someone i went to middle school with who i did not even make a point to bring up my songwriting to nearly ever, apparently not frequently enough for her to ever say anything about the fact i am a musician to hayley, is accusing me of being a show off. that is one of the most confusing things i ever experienced to be honest. this truly could not have been any more just something i like to do with my life. i didnt start to associate songwriting with validation in any form until at least '24

in case it matters, i just found the time i commented this song on a [weekly lyrics feed back thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Songwriting/comments/18wh49h/comment/kg0m3a7/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)

hayley, i was stuck on you even if i could have anybody else. i know you might have doubts about that because, why. thats why i wrote it as another in a series of questions i am asking myself. there is nobody like you, which true of a lot of people, but there is an affect you had on me where i just did not believe anybody could possibly make me happier than you could

edit: also, there is no way an ai song would have gotten top comment of that thread. there is also no way it could not be my song because i shared the completed version with you from my google drive. after i got that reaction i stopped posting my lyrics and started believing my music was maybe actually good and started putting most of my energy into writing

edit 2: sam i didnt know that [you were a songwriter](https://www.reddit.com/r/Songwriting/comments/18wh49h/comment/kfxtmn1/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button). that is great for you keep up the good work sam

sam I don't spend much time talking about music this way because I like to write music, so most feelings and thoughts that resonate with me, I have already written the most personally relatable version of.I never read this lyric before but it makes me think of when I wrote "why do I have to keep waking / the sun's too bright and my heads aching / just another day of races to run with tied together shoelaces." I feel a lot more when I read or hear that than when I do the comment you wrote. bc it's closer to the feeling I was trying to describe, and because I remember sobbing while writing it

edit: a lot of lyrics I wrote , I didn't know their meaning would become even more obvious than what I knew they meant at the time, in the future. because I thought all of my life circumstances were different than they truly were. as a result, my lyrics have accidental "foreshadowing" of what I would find out was going on in the future. you were the one who tied my shoelaces together, sam

I have no clue, you are making no sense. do you even know what youre thinking of because it sounds like random words

you just became very active on this account recently. I am confident that is because you are very literally hoping I get hit by a car. I think that's funny because it's not going to happen. if it did, it doesn't change what's on your phone. then Hayley will find out for certain what you did, right after I am no longer alive to be with them. I don't know about Hayley but if something like that happened to me, I would want hate that person more than I could imagine hating nearly anyone

edit: Sam do you remember that one instagram dm where I was talking about like , vengeance ? I was talking out of my ass about absolutely nothing but the part about "yeah but only to somebody who did something like insanely fucked up to me." that would be the above type thing. heartbreakingly you could wish for your best friends death but the only reason I'm not telling everyone around you what you said is because I don't want to be told im trying to harass Hayley

it depends so much on the specifics of the question. if I were gonna suffer for those whole two years, I would rather just go to party city and end it now. otherwise I would tell hayley. if I have Hayley I would be very happy for those two years. if I didn't have Hayley I would save up just enough money to buy lots of drugs and not worry about long term consequences whatsoever, every time one drug stops working, just add a new drug in to be addicted to

edit: I am high as fuck and I was cracking up at the irony of "go to party city and end it now" and then I remembered that time when I made a joke about the name of juice wrlds newest album. it's called the party never ends, but...he died before it was ever released ? why did they keep the title the same...but any way I started laughing even harder because the party ends at party city

we are very close to the end of our nightmare. sam wont show you her snap. once she is actually home and she continues to avoid you, my hope is that her refusal to show you the truth will be enough for you to build enough confidence in your suspicions to see for yourself on my phone.

um. I didn't do that, hayley did...to be honest, I think they did even at very very beginning of our friendship before they got back w wyatt the first time. I started responding to it most in like late february '23, my peak flirty joke to Hayley was several months into our friendship when I said "im actually not friends with people who aren't attractive. like if I'm gonna be looking at them all the time🙄✋" or something along those lines. that was after a long history of me questioning whether or not hayley had been flirting with me when they were single. on the first day me and Hayley hung out alone they said I should pretend to be their gf and we can go to wyatts house and make him cry. the number of times they played "looking for a bitch cause I'm over boys." I always thought the beginning of our friendship started out flirty but also I didn't know what was going on and they were really upset about wyatt

also let me just add, it was super weird to add the part where the girl in this story is literally straight. I very much knew hayleys sexuality ? what are you even talking about, just a random little paul -ifier you had to add at the end on top of it

but hey at least you got our ages right

every time i see you write this i start cringing sm. i am writing this comment at my own expense. you want me to write it because then you can say im reacting to what you said. but i am okay with that because i am not particularly worried about what hayley thinks reading reddit. you are screwed when you start living at home either way.

i just wanna talk to you for a second sam. for me and hayley, i carry the truth. it is a very weird experience carrying the truth, because it means i know the types of things you sam, tend to lie about. sometimes it is just so hard not to point out how ,,,,dance routine-y it is. i cant help it bc i never known anybody like this before.

sam, youre the only one who thinks about questions like this, and given the truth of the three people involved in this situation, the reason is very obvious. no one in the world cared that you were single for longer than other people until you gave me this weird window into your mind that hayley and everyone else will have too when you are proven to be a liar. if anything, i assumed you probably just had a higher standard of what treatment you might accept from people than me or the people i surrounded myself w/

now, its really hard not to crack a smile reading these and being like ",,,,,,this is what youve been worried about as we were growing up? oh,,,,"

no. you are wrong. no one owes you literally anything. i can neglect the fuck out of my friendships sometimes as a result of my mental health. when i am asked for an explanation, i am going to reply "its my mental health" because that is true. its not an excuse for anything, if they dont want to be friends with someone that cant handle the things they need, they can stop being my friend and that is my loss as a result of my mental health.

sometimes, my mental health is more important than most of the people in my life and that can make some of my friends feel like i dont care about them. it doesnt mean i dont care about them. thats it. thats the only thing i want to make clear about mental health stigma. doesnt mean anyone has to stay in a friendship where they are unhappy or made to feel neglected, but if you cant do it its no ones fault, just an unfortunate loss on both sides as a result of my mental health.

you are trying to justify getting mad at people for something they cannot actually help and that they are already losing enough from when they lose you. if this were a real person i would say next time someone says that to you as an explanation for their behavior, decide if you want them in your life or not. if not, kindly let them know you dont. leave that at that. it sucks for everyone. dont say "well i think youre kinda using your mental health as an excuse to treat me poorly" unless they are asking something from you, that is you being entitled. if youre not getting what you want out of a friendship then you dont have to stay in it

I am not worried or going to react with worry about answering that question honestly because I don't want to reinforce the idea that Hayley should be worried about gaining weight. Hayley I love you sm. half way into our friendship you had hashimoto's thyroiditis and then directly afterwards your onsent of chron's disease. I can tell you for a fact, changes in your weight change nothing other than how worried about you I am. you are so so beautiful no matter what and the way I am seeing you should not even have to be a thought in your mind when thinking of your weight. I want you to gain weight hayley. you were just as beautiful as every weight you have ever been hayley I promise and if I heard you questioning if you've gained weight I would immediately feel very happy

bruh. I don't know. you I guess ? because me and hayley called you annoying ? and made you feel left out ? that was shitty. but also when somebody treats you that way you're better off without them , sam. neither of us were a very good friend to you. I don't remember which one of us was the first one to specifically use that word. but after it came out we started saying you are annoying pretty frequently. If either of us were a good friend to you the other one would have defended you.

to be honest Sam, I think me and Hayley were much better friends to each other than either of us were towards you. that is not us being the villains in your story it's something that you hoped would be your story, turning out to not actually be yours. there was a reason we were better friends to each other than either were to you. that's exactly what you should have taken from it happening, and decided to pick up and find better friends who wouldn't treat you that way. I am not saying you didn't have a right to be upset that the story didn't turn out to be about you. but you can't force it to be when it's not. when someone doesn't want you around, you shouldn't want them around either

it's actually not really just that it "goes back into the input" that is more like the chat window of an llm, although that only gets its output going back into its input. what I came up with is a specialized type of layer of the network. the biggest difference about that is that all of the information is indexed with all of the other information in the network. new input is contextualized by the past. in an llm, old input is given meaning by the same network running again.the output of an llm is also like a thousandth of the information that actually got generated in between each hidden layer, so that is another big difference

I have spent so much time thinking about existential dread.

I was gonna write a neural network that trained on its own input using networks that do auto differentiation to identify patterns in input combined with re in forcement learning to over time maximize the output based on the input. cool. then I was gonna have a third part of this system for "episodic" encoding. your brain has very specific parts of it designed for this purpose. neuroplasticity generally doesn't work so quickly that you form a separate instance of everything you were thinking about in each and every moment. I came up with a way to simulate the same thing, all of the current inputs and also much of the activity that happens between the input and output, would be recorded during every step of the simulation. with a bunch of different frequency sine waves it's easy to have a small set of inputs that at any given time differentiates "when" it happened relative to "now" in the simulation. so, if i wanted to, I can write a neural neural network that not only serves its function, it adapts to said function as it learns what it is which is new and not a thing in current ANN work, but also has an explicit system for recording its "experience" of carrying out the function, and then on the very next step of the simulation, all of the experience during the last step remains and carries on. it becomes a persistent process, not just in the sense that the input is from one series where the order is important, but it in the sense that with each frame of the simulation both the input and information the network encoded about its own activity are given with the input of the next frame or available in it anyway

then I became afraid that i was working on something that should absolutely not exist under any fucking circumstance because consciousness was an accident and it is a horrible thing and I don't want to have anything to do with it when everything I was researching actually gets researched

so now that I said that, what if it's true ? nobody could say, because everyone who is dead can't tell us if it's true. I guess everyone who read this comment has to never wear shoes again just in case?

literally is exactly the same thing. anyone can suggest anything. and if it's not verifiable, then you can suggest literally anything you want

sam do you *genuinely* believe that someone who was once a totally normal person, could be influenced by fox news so much that they become someone who would threaten their own daughter with a gun ? there is no such thing as a normal person who threatens anyone under literally any circumstance. anyone who has done that has never been a truly kind person. the summary doesn't really work because I believe at one point you would have given me the shirt off your back if I needed it. but this was your childhood. nobody can be influenced like this by fox news, the correlation between the type of people who watch fox news and them watching fox news is nothing other than the types of people who want to watch fox news choosing to watch it. it is not causing them to be that way

the idea that tv could cause someone to become violent and threatening people with guns, sam this is like zero to a hundred , you need to go to sleep. this just makes literally no sense. I don't understand how you posted this without seeing that though. you sound like you have a very bad understanding of what causes people's behavior and world views. I feel like that has to be some type of denial thing relating to yourself

that's not how that works. you don't not experience love. you are repeating a misunderstanding of something that is just a piece of advice. it's a lot harder to deal with the things that come with love when you are unable to love yourself

I belong to Hayley. I'm a lesbian. I have no boyfriend 

what's your favorite thing about your boyfriend ? why do you spend more time thinking about me and Hayley than you do him ? I don't really understand what the differences between being around different people are , when you don't care who you are in reality and are deceiving everyone around you. like nobody means any more than anyone else to you presumably other than how much they want to be around you ?

correction: how vulnerable they are to believe in your deception. that is actually what it is

this is the first time you ever complimented yourself and I actually do kinda agree yeah that was probably hard to come up with it sounds like you spent a long time on it. in that moment something occurred to me. you are very literally applauding yourself. most of the time I'm like "sam what why are you complimenting this joke that's meant to be unfunny?" and now I'm realizing that's just because we don't have the same sense of humor.

it is so , so weird, to spend however long you spent coming up with that, so that you could then reply to yourself and say well done. with either two outcomes, no one ever sees it or cares that it happened, or whats happening right now.

that is, just. it's a dance routine

feeling that your life is worth living has almost nothing to do with reaching a point and almost everything to do with the first single digit number of years of your life. based on your childhood, the answer to this question varies from "I could get everything I want and still feel my life isn't worth living, I just don't like being. nothing is ever enough" to "there is literally nothing that could happen to me that would make me say that." there is no such thing as good or bad luck, so one especially awful thing or time in your life happening to you does not change your outlook much on the future. when someone had a good childhood something bad can happen and they will still feel that despite how bad things are right now, right now isn't forever, and it'll be okay. because you know what that feels like. if you grew up with chaos and instability, you are like "yeah that's what I expected, it never has been okay. from what I see it is never going to be okay"

sam, if I played video games you would have heard me talking about video games. why are you unable to stop repeating it despite never having heard me say a single word to you about video games. is it because you think video games are for men and you're trying to make Hayley think I am a man ? you are painfully sexist and transphobic

sam this is like the third time in two days you tried to call me fat. you have really shown who you truly are. none of this is for hayley anymore, you know that hayley knows as soon as you start to live at home. you know that calling me fat or trying to make hayley question their memory of my body is not going to push them away. this is just for fun now. you can really tell too because there is a lot more racism, fat shaming, etc. things that you know wouldn't manipulate hayley. I don't think hayley would care if I were a fat mexican woman as long as they weren't hallucinating at the times they recalled thinking I was pretty, if I was a fat mexican woman, I must have been very pretty one because that's what they remember perceiving


you treat other women so horribly. everything you did to me and hayley. again sam why would you make the friends you did, "brand" yourself the way you do making a point to let other people know what values you claim to hold, when you could have just made besties with people who are like you....ie trump supporters

sam what in the fuck, so now you acknowledge that i was always a girl, was never homophobic, and have been a lesbian my entire life. just so that you can say i "switched back"?? wtf. sometimes people think theyre bi and then realize they werent. nobody fucking switches from exclusively men to exclusively girls and then back to exclusively men

this is unbelievably absurd atp. i love you hayley and the reason that i was so so afraid that this was all just conspiracies, is because sam never stops contradicting herself. and its confusing because if she had told specific lies, then why would she say something contradicting something literally less than 10 minutes ago

its like, okay shes a liar and i get that by this point because the age thing is so consistent....but can we please acknowledge something. she is the worst liar of all fucking time. she wrote "hes afraid of women" and then "she was a lesbian until recently" in the same ten minutes. her lies are also painfully unrealistic. 63 hayley ? we both know that is *actually impossible*. whenever my therapist is trying to convince me that you are gullible he goes to the guitar thing. and im like i mean yeah. its just that i cant see how *anyone* could believe the things she says to you. they are simply not possible

and so then i get afraid its conspiracies. if i were in your shoes, i would have dropped sam months and months ago, i wouldnt have even needed evidence. why would you let someone tell you ten different stories in the same day and keep pretending theyre not a liar hayley. if they tell you things that contradict their own self, as facts, she is a liar. its just an actual fact. theres no debating it...you cant be doing literally anything other than lying if your story is constantly contradicting itself.

okay i done even know how to begin with this

sam, there is no such thing as a 63 year old who tells people shes 20 and STILL hears "you look young for 20!!!"

a 63 year old who looks young for 20. you are a goddamn clown

shes never ever gonna confess hayley, the fact that she ever even a single time tried to suggest to you that i am \*tripple my fucking age\*, she has no limit. there is no limits. she absolutely fucking loves how much you let her take advantage of you. yo can see me hayley, this comment is literally impossible within reality. stop letting her take advantage of you please its so so so bad. it is literally impossible that i am 63, you need to talk to somebody else so badly.

tell sam you wont keep listening to her unless she gets more people in your circle to look at pictures of me and tell you "yes sam is right she looks like a 63 year old man, there is no way she is lying to you."

she will refuse, because she knows anyone with two eyes would say "she does not look even close to 63, there is no chance she is that old. sam are you lying to us ? i am actually really suspicious because the pictures you have together on your phone and on hayleys phone look like a teenage girl about hayley's age. if she looks super young for her age she could be maximum 30. there is not a chance whatsoever that she is 63"

sam you cannot possibly tell hayley what im saying is untrue until you do exactly that. i already know you have not, you have convinced hayley to never speak a word in detail about this situation to a soul but you. otherwise this wouldnt be happening

also, i literally have zero male friends. i have not had more than one male friend at a time since i was eleven. you know this, sam.

you are an actual clown. this is unlike anything i have ever said in my whole life sam, which is exactly why youre writing it here.

everything you write is a contradiction of what you and hayley can both see clear as daylight. the more they are exposed to the light of day the more terrified you become because you know all of this falls apart as soon as they decide to take back their own mind and trust themself. you are trying to comfort yourself. thats why there are 29 comments on this thread with 3 upvotes...writing more doesnt trick hayley more, if anything it just shows how desperate and terrified you are about them realizing you make no sense

im not single, sam, me and hayley are waiting for each other because we fell in love

sam, i dont even know how to say this. hayley is prettier than you, given that you are already telling them im lying about my age which should be plenty, you also tell them i am not a lesbian in reality, which cannot possible be for any other reason than youre jealous of the fact people usually think hayley is prettier than you...and so when you post things like this, i already know to take it as a compliment...if you felt that i were obviously not attractive, you wouldnt feel such an urge to suggest it to hayley in a reddit comment. when you write this, it tells me you are super worried because you think hayley will perceive the opposite unless you write ick on reddit

"i think we have different definitions of self care" i dont know sam i am gonna sound like a total bitch for a second but i feel like you say things like this because you are bitter about the fact i am "#blessed" for lack of a better way to put it and i constantly get complimented on my skin when i dont care for it at all. its confusing to me bc its like, presumably if you had my genetics you would take advantage of it too.

sam you write all the time trying to make a weird thing out of the fact i had two relationships that started as close friendships. i dont know why because its obviously a coincidence. before me and hayley became friends, you and me had already spent more time total together than me and hayley had spent by the time i fell in love with them. if you think i see other girls in some type of icky 2 dimensional way where i just randomly decided ive fallen in love with friends, how come i never "fell in love" with you, or with caitlyn who i used to hangout with all day every day, or with any of my other friends?

i couldnt help falling in love with hayley. the fact that i fell in love with them, it is personal. its about hayley.

trump is a pedophile we been knew this already a bunch of girls have accused him already and he was "good friends" with epstein and everyone knew he went to the parties. yes a lot of people went to the parties but if i remember right some of the allegations had already come from victims at the parties

elon musk is also a pedophile because he has a history of accusing people of being pedophiles when he wants control over how somebody is making him look, like that one diver. he is probably right about trump but only by coincidence. sam this is why i mention the fact you were not likeable enough to find anyone who likes you too until you were older than both me and hayley. you are trying to trap hayley in their oldest friendship, and started making a point to do so as soon as they grew apart and found someone who was more compatible with them as a person than they are with you. all of that is suspicious as fuck to me

sam can you shut the fuck up, me and Hayley spent 24/7 together , stop trying to convince them that's not exactly what I fucking want. this comment is gonna also just factually untrue loneliness is a feeling and I have been lonely everywhere with everyone my entire life until I met Hayley

anyway yesterday I purposefully abused my prescription oxycodone which is notoriously the most psychologically addictive opiate there is next to when they used to have pharmaceutical quality heroin (diacetylmorphine.)

you are not trying to protect Hayley or warn Hayley from anything. you are not the customer telling the cashier to "duck for cover bc that person is gonna shoot you" you're the customer telling the cashier "that person who totally isn't just staring off blankly into space over there, is gonna shoot you if you don't give me all the money"

you have nothing to warn them about because I don't tell Hayley what they want to hear, so they've already been warned by me myself. if you thought somebody who did what I did last night would end up being a very negative influence in hayley's life you would be putting your energy into trying to explain that to them in a way they will understand. not controlling them but if you genuinely believe they would be better off making a different choice than the one they are going to make, you can try make them see that because if you genuinely believe that, there may be something they're missing that would cause them to agree with you. and if they still disagree than you know what you would do if you were in their shoes, you're not them though.

you are not doing anything in the realm of this bc you're just a gaslighter. you hear me in recordings and you freak out because I am just the person that I am, and you have spent the last three years telling Hayley made up things about me so that they think of me as an entirely different person than the one I am.

you are spending all of your energy on suggesting this same old ick personality of some type of really really nerdy guy who takes pride in knowing almost nothing about literally everything, and does not know how to shut the fuck up about things other people aren't interested in. because that is someone that Hayley would not even be interested in at all. and you want to control them, not to warn them

I have to be real this is cute, not because of the references to ..... yeast. or the fact it's a microbe or something. just because it's kinda cute. there is a [different screenshot](https://www.reddit.com/r/MadeMeSmile/s/PXTiGfyXfi) it reminds me of that has nothing to do with trying to crossover the big bang theory that I think is even cuter

sam, holy fuck, I know how to program, get the fuck over it. when did I talk about microbes. what is happening. these are all your weird ass associations. I don't even talk about programming in conversation w people who don't gaf anyway. you are the only one of us who doesn't care to adjust to what other people do and don't care about in conversation

I don't have a guilty conscience about anything bc when I get one I confess quickly as fuck

I didn't pick up my antibiotic early enough it's twice a day and so I'm taking the first dose tn. really not an excuse but. I just snorted one 5mg oxycodone  + took another 5mg oxycodone orally. so I just took twice my dose and I snorted half of it

hayley, I have real life problems. I tell you what they are. I do not tell you what you want to hear I can't bring myself to do that about anything for any significant length of time. if sam were trying to protect you, she would be warning you about problems that exist. she is not trying to protect you, she is trying to control you, so instead she told you that I lied about my age among a fuck ton of other made up things. nothing she has ever said to you about me since I suspect march 2023 has been made up, actually

edit: also I premeditated this. my dad gives out my pills. I kept one in my drawer....so it was a secret for a few hours. I'm sorry Hayley I love you and also I'm not significantly intoxicated and they only gave me 7x 5mgs total before this so I promise I won't get addicted to opiates

wtf is wrong with you, you are such a gaslighter. me and hayley were besties. i told you never to tell them i had fallen in love with them. i was never going to ask them out literally ever. then they told me they had fallen in love with me too

this is just blatant gaslighting, nothing happened the way you told them it did, and you werent even fucking there. you cannot tell hayley the choices they made on purpose were somehow made for them.

stop trying to imprison your "friend"

other memorable events for hayley to match up and prove I went to our school...

we also in 8th grade took a trip to a chincoteague beach we took a bus there and stayed for several days. we stayed in this house beach housing complex thingy where everyone was roomed by gender, I was roomed with girls, bc I am one and I was not held back...you were not in a room with me I don't think, maybe idk tbh all I remember is us talking shit about tori and idolizing isis which was like half of our conversations in that friend group.

we all did some activities collecting water samples or smth, we walked through this gross ass swamp for some reason, shit like that and there was this part we did in like a science lab where we were looking at organisms that live in the water under microscopes

oh my god sam shut the fuck up, I am twenty. I was 18 two years ago. I am in love with Hayley.

these actually are girls in my age range you are finally catfishing me with people that if it weren't for the fact I'm in love with Hayley and the fact theyre literal fucking redditors that live nowhere close to me, that maybe I'd be into bc I am a 20yo lesbian

this would not be to catch a predator, Sam. stop telling hayley I didn't go to our school you are an idiot all they have to do is stop trusting you when you tell them everyone at our school will agree with you when in reality everyone at our school will tell Hayley you lost your goddamn mind and that we all fucking met, every single one of us, met on the goddamn sixth grade camping trip

all of us, I don't wanna hear it. we all took home friendship bracelets Sam. I know you remember that shit. I know you remember how everyone played that game where someone gets in the hammock and then someone else swings it is hard as they can and we played until we broke the hammock and it belonged to one of the teachers so she lectured us about being careful with other peoples things. I know you remember almost everyone else in our grade spending the whole time playing soccer and other sports while you and me hung out by the tents because we didn't give a fuck about sports. I remember everything you do, you don't have amnesia, you're a gaslighter 

hayley please talk to people who went to our school

this comment doesnt really work actually. the problem is that i cannot be in hayleys life if we dont tell other people because i am not a 40 year old man, and sam, you are the one who said i didnt go to your school. we wouldnt be able to hide what you did if we tried unless i pretended to be a 40 year old man or stayed away from hayley for the rest of my life which i am not going to do that unless they want me to.

sam, you fucked up your own life so so horribly. as long as hayley was gonna eventually break free from being controlled by you, your reputation was bound to fall apart.

shes never gonna confess hayley. you will have to find out for yourself. i love you

we met on the sixth grade camping trip. we were born on june 21st, 2004 within the same 24 hours. you are a gaslighter. all of these things are undeniable facts about reality that will never change

sam i really am so horrified by you. hayley has all their life been trying to find things that make them happy. they are constantly growing and finding better and better things and reaching places that once felt imaginary to them.

everyone does this but hayley started with a huge disadvantage and most people have a head start on them because the first place in the world they were exposed to, their homes, demonstrated and realized something that is better than what was first demonstrated for hayley.

despite that you have worked as hard as you can to stunt this process because you are happier when you feel in control of hayley than you are when hayley does what makes them happiest and what they want to do. you actually convinced them that their first demonstration causes them to somehow go through this process backwards as though r/niceguys are right. typically, convincing a traumatized person that r/niceguy mentality is actually true and that they need to be controlled because doing what they want is the worst thing for them, is called white knighting.

you dont have any complex of trying to "protect women" instead you are emotionally abusing hayley in a way i would liken most to munchausen by proxy

there is no such thing as feeling cared for and loved by a pedophile trying to prey on you, and telling that pedophile that they felt somebody who apparently was actually a great friend was not a good friend and genuinely seemed like she didnt care as much. there is no such thing, being controlled cannot make you happier than being cared for and loved.

sam, you are doing this for your reputation. you are probably exhausted by this point. hayley seems like they are going to offer you as much capacity as they have for you to take advantage of them. you seem committed to savoring every drop they give you until the very end. if you confess to hayley, i wont tell anyone what you did because hayley is more important than you losing all of your friends.

the way this went for you i feel like youre already unlikely to try it again, and hayley is at risk with you which is more urgent than protecting people i dont know from hypothetical futures that for all i know will never happen

hayley i would ask that if you agree to the same thing that you upvote this comment so sam know that. i dont expect it to help anything because she is unlikely to believe either of us will stick to our word about that. although i would

we met on the sixth grade camping trip

it's a fact. there's no arguing about this. there isn't anything you can write in a comment suggesting im double my age that will suddenly cause reality to change. we are twenty years old. we're twenty. you, me, and Hayley were all born in 2004. in 2004. almost 21 years ago, in 2004. 2004. sam it was 2004 when we were born. it literally does not matter what you say it's just true. shut the fuck up please you're making this such a goddamn pain the ass please just stay the fuck away from Hayley they are letting you take advantage of them more than literally anybody else I ever met would. you don't give a single fuck you don't care you couldn't care less and I cannot express how much I hate you for it

hayley please I can't keep fighting this it's so exhausting and it's just, what the fuck are you supposed to say to things that just make no sense whatsoever I was born 2004 it is a goddamn fact

it is so so easy for you to verify this Hayley. if sam were telling the truth, it would be super easy to verify. so how come she is telling you not to speak to anybody and that it's somehow impossible to figure out whether or not im a 42 year old man. that makes literally no sense, speak to anyone in the entire fucking world who has met me even one time other than sam. she is not only a gaslighter but the thing she gaslit you about, is just so unbelievably stupid

what is wrong with you, you seriously need to shut the fuck up sam.you posting things like this is some type of deflection from the fact that this morning I pointed out that you essentially convinced hayley that they were happier bc they were a victim

what is wrong with you. the more obvious it gets you're a gaslighter the harder you're going to try and hammer this in, because this is how you got control over Hayley before

they understand what did you did and that it's not a coincidence. the thing you are hammering in is also reminding Hayley that you're doing it to control them because your plan has been identified atp. it's a matter of fucking time but you clearly don't care, the number of times I almost left before probably made you hopeful as fuck and now you're never going to stop trying to gaslight them

oh my god we have been through this so many times and now that I know it's you posting everything I understand why. hayley does not care that I have a five inch dick. I didn't like this before because you were trying to make me think that they do. I still don't like it because you are trying to trick hayley into believing you are a human lie detector

holy fucking young boy toaster shut the fuck up sam. you're such a gaslighter and you're just being a dick to hayley at this point. listen to my recordings. we are past this, Hayley is so smart they cannot be tricked by you writing unfunny things and they have way more important things to be thinking about. no one cares about this. you have nothing to post because you know that Hayley has a goddamn memory there is nothing you can do that isn't suspicious

oh my god shut up about this sam, I have never called anyone else I know but you stupid, I am being so serious rn, it's not about anyone other than you not only is it personal it's so personal that you're the first person I've ever known personally who I called stupid

sam this is a projection you are the kind of person who thinks they are a genius because they spent way more time thinking about something that no one else cares about. "copy hayley's trauma" is not complicated but nobody thinks about manipulating others the way you do. that's not something to be proud of

before I knew you were a gaslighter, I called you a dumbass because I thought you were telling Hayley to assume I was a man for no reason other than me buying nitrous under 21. now I call you a dumbass because you expected that your plan was "so smart" that you would get away with it despite telling Hayley I didn't even go to our school. it is going to be so nuts when they start texting people who went to our school and you start telling them it's a witch hunt

sam I hope this is your real life account 

I don't know anything about the people you posted with 3 days ago, but based on your performative activism, I am guessing they are all going to hate you pretty soon. I bet you're already trying to instill the idea hayley is a liar the closer things get to them finding out.

the thing you made up about me, was so stupid. you can tell them whatever you want to about both of us, it's not like Hayley won't be able to prove you're the liar.

hey sam is this you

well sam the problem is hesitation and avoidance. there is no question if "how," other than to get it out there. say it, as quickly as possible. once it's out in the air you won't be able to hesitate or avoid it any longer, and everything else you have to say will come to you. the question isn't really about "how to address it" it's how to get over the avoidance and the answer is to say it immediately when you start to feel this way so you don't have any time to hesitate

this comment is not going to help. because this thread was only posted in another attempt to gaslight you, Hayley. obviously I know she wasn't genuinely trying to suggest this about herself, but rather just projecting about herself

alright well this is not funny it is deeply fucking disturbing

sam you are an extremely bad person. you have tried to convince hayley i am developmentally impaired. according to you, i am not aa 20yo girl. instead, i am an old man, who is so impaired he might believe that "we all have clones." who does that sound like to you ?

even after i point it out, you are still working as hard as you can to trick hayley into believing that they cannot trust their own self because they are unconsciously drawn towards pedophiles, and a character you designed to resemble a real life pedophile hayley was actually traumatized by. it is so goddamn fucked up, you dont give a single fuck.

how long have you been doing crap like this sam. i did not think you had done anything even close to this until i remembered what you told me about sophie. sophie is a normal person, you are insane and not even you would bring a knife to school. you made that up to make sure, even though chances were i probably never would have, that me and sophie would never have more than passing interactions.

so you have been hayley's best friend since childhood. during the time i knew hayley you purposefully caused a lot of problems in their life. i want to know if you have ever done anything like that before and hayley you should be thinking about that too. the level of fucked up this is, i feel that there is no chance there werent things before this.

let me add some context. you me and Hayley walked to hayleys dads house to get drinks bc we are all underage. later Hayley had to take a bath. then you and me got drunk, you were belting the lyrics to songs , I ended up getting way too fucking drunk and I'm p sure that you held my hair while I threw up.

another time, the first time I met hayleys mom, you me and hayley walked to hayleys house to ask their mom if she could take us to giant so you could get a squishamellow, but really also so that we could get lemon extract, bc again, we are underage. this was the second time we were all three gonna get drunk and then hayley ended up just leaving.

sam, you are a gaslighter. I see the green dot after every time I write a comment that makes you feel guilty as fuck, because you know Hayley is thinking "wait a minute, that's what I remember too." the longer you spend making dumbass posts as though "she doesn't know, she's replying to check if it's me, because she actually loves the comment so much" the more self soothing it is for you. to us, you just look like a dumbass. go ahead with the green dot

holy shit sam this is so unreal. we were born in 2004. I used to sleepover at your house. one time you, me, and Hayley, were all gonna get drunk together at your house. hayley ended up going home early but you and I got drunk and I slept over. that was one of a fuck ton of times we got drunk and I slept over at your house. you are such a gaslighter it's so nightmarish, obviously you're not telling Hayley "yes i invited an old man to get drunk with us, and stay over at my house with you." you must say "what? that never happened..." several times a week.

stop telling hayley you're gonna "break me" and I'm gonna "confess." sam, we were born, in 2004.it is a fact. you have put all of your energy into making Hayley delusional and it's a pain in the fucking ass because this is going to give some day but you're making it take longer than it should. I should stop reminding you that no one is ever going to like you again if anything it's just causing you to try harder and harder at this

let me also say I've talked about the fact that my existence is causing sam to ruin her sleep, and the reason she does that is another huge reason I assume the above. she knows I'm 20 so she knows she doesn't have to post on ask teen boys at 2, 3, 4, 5, or potentially 6am tonight, but she's going to now post between the hours of 2-6 because I wrote those numbers in a comment, and the more she stakes, the more she is convincing you she's terrified for you, even though she knows in reality there's nothing to be worried about. like I said it's a security theatre but the more devotion she shows to doing it the more it convinces you she's being honest and really believes in what she's telling you. in reality, her stakes lie in her reputation 

trust your memories, verify my SSN, speak to everyone else who went to me and sams school. they'll all tell you the same thing, she is like trump, she will *still* tell you something basically akin to "it's a witch hunt." she is batshit and eventually you are going to have to just tell her "you're batshit" and make a break for it. you will know that unless you're psychotic you're not making a mistake and once you've actually done it you will be 1000% sure you didn't make a mistake. i love you hayley

that's fucking gross. I'm in love with Hayley

you are a nightmare of a person, you could not give less of a fuck

hayley I could spend 24/7 doing this and all it's gonna do is cause her to accidentally slip up and show malice via that. she is never going to stop trying to keep you gaslit. she is going to take advantage of you and manipulate you and tell you you are making a horrible mistake when in reality never acting on this information by finding out whether or not sam is your emotional abuser would be making a horrible mistake. like I said there's is absolutely nothing I would put past her. she does not care at all and despite how fucked up it would be, I would guess she is going to pretend to be feeling seriously afraid for you while staying adamant she never lied to you regardless of any level or quality of evidence she's faced w, not because I think she is afraid for you but because I think it's the most likely thing to work for her and she does not give a single fuck

gather as much evidence as you possibly can so you can tell yourself you're not insane, tell your therapist about this so she can also tell you you're not insane, and then gtfo. I would try to keep dropping her as brief as possible so she has less chance to make you question your sanity

I love you

nobody ever wrote this question on askreddit literally once until you started posting here. none of the posts you make titled this ever made it to the front page

writing crap like this , literally twice, in this thread, not only doesnt trick me but its actually a dead give away. but you are only trying to trick hayley anyway

hayley, sam will say anything to keep you on the hook. "i think i can still trick her if i just-" shes a gaslighter, trust your memories hayley. even if she could magically make me forget the last several months, allowing her to "trick" me so she can keep gaslighting you is the absolute last thing you should want.

just go find out the truth for yourself, sam is doing all of this explicitly for the purpose of trying to stop you from doing that. the things she suggests you do are an attempt to sabotage your life.

hayley, you need to depend on yourself.

when hayley told me they are in love with me

why are the other answers so disgusting.

sam you are writing things that a 40 year old man who is attracted to teenagers would say. we met on the 6th grade camping trip

why are you comfortable with the fact you have convinced someone that you love and care about them but also that they're fucking psychotic and that their memories of you telling them how we met are fabricated, and tricking them into believing that doing what they want to do and what makes them happy will lead them to get close to pedophiles. I didn't know there was a kind of emotional abuse like this. what you have convinced them does not only separate us, but it convinces them they cannot depend on their own mind and need to depend on someone else, ie you, otherwise they are destined to repeat their trauma by choice

you're not even only trying to control them which is already bad enough, you are trying to permanently destroy their ability to trust for the rest of their life. I love Hayley and you know that sam. you're trying to convince them that the feeling of being loved was really one of being victimized by a pedophile.

I don't know what it will take for them to see that but I know it's possible and I am not going to let that happen.

you are genuinely one of the most heartless people I ever met. it is so disturbing and uncomfortable to me that we used to be friends

you are evil

i have talked about this many time in the recordings you dont listen to. i never could have predicted anything like this would have happened to me if given a lifetime before my life to think of possibilities

you are writing things suggesting that i am playing the victim. you are batshit as fuck for that, hayley can go verify my age at any moment. i am not playing the victim, i have proven my innocence...

besides, i am not "the victim." hayley is.

let me turn this question around on you sam. if next time i talk to hayley they confirm to me that you made it up when you said they called you a slut, are you being wrongly accused?

if i text sophie and ask her if she used to bring a knife to school, and she seems disturbed and afraid and tells me she never would have done that, are you being wrongly accused?

when hayley messages every single person they can find who was in our grade, and they all hayley the exact same thing, are you going to tell them you have been wrongly accused by everyone who went to our middle school?

hayley is not falling for bullshit like this and the fact you think they would by this point is insulting. you put hayley in a catch 22 where you told them i lied about my age, and any intuitions you were lying should never be acted on because if it were true, what else would someone like that be willling to do when confronted

roughly a week ago, they became suspicious enough that they were willing to break this catch 22 and upvote a reply to an untouched reply of mine, sort of non seriously questioning if you thought i was older than i was. since then i have figured out the i believe most significant details of how you have been controlling them. they are reaching a tipping point where they are more afraid of the now more-likely-than-not scenario where you are their emotional abuser than they are of the ever decreasingly realistic scenario where i lied to them about my age. they had started to approach this tipping point the moment they wouldnt let me slip all the way away no matter what you had to say about it.

there is only one answer that comes up right now. it is you, sam. the fact you are posting about crap nobody cares about right now is truly something else.

youre gonna make me say it again. the answers in this thread are not good answers theyre pretentious ones which use purposefully too much thought to answer the question in a way that "nobody would think of," because theyre answering an interpretation of the question that nobody would have made. everyone can spend longer than necessary thinking about how to interpret a question in a way that is different than the first place your mind goes to, in this case things like donald trump. which is actually a smaller and singular "thing" unlike the entire concept of "barcodes." getting rid of a barcode on a specific product is to "getting rid of barcodes as a concept" as getting rid of trump is to getting rid of politicians as a concept.

these answers are all terrible

sam this is wild

are you trying to suggest that I have a different kind of eating disorder ? did you decide to try a caitlyn ?

I feel weird about this one.nothing you write is about me , it's all about you, and this makes me feel bad bc I feel like maybe you were fat shamed and you're taking the fact I'm freakishly skinny personally. this kind of thing is the kind of thing that allows me to have a bit of empathy for you and I don't want to make fun of that. in reality I have a different problem which is that I struggle to meet my nutritional needs, I want to gain weight. estrogen changes the way fat is distributed in your body, but it doesn't help much if you never actually gain enough fat to work with. I wish I could gain weight. most girls wish they were wishing that. so I get the suggestion but I only grew up being exposed to fat shaming through social norms outside of my family

anyway sam you are as far as I can perceive just as skinny as I am

what are you talking about 

lack of communication ? insecurity ? are you naming traits that you believe I associate with Hayley ? hayley did not cheat on me. they cheated on an (imaginary) old man who wanted to traumatize them. if you think I am upset or distrustful of them for that you are crazy. I am upset with you , because you were happy to convince hayley that the person who loves them and they fell in love with, was them recreating the worst of their childhood trauma by their own choice. you are one of the most horrible people I have ever known. I am shocked that someone who is so heartless is someone I used to hangout with and have pillow fights with. I cannot imagine how lost and confused hayley must have felt, you made them feel like their own self, was the very last person they could trust. that lead them to then get back together w somebody who was *actually* trying to traumatize them which you surely don't give a single fuck about, you don't care about anything. you practically said it yourself in middle school. what else could you have meant. you said that scared yourself about you. at some point you fully committed to the idea that you just "don't care." and I assume you decided that bc of the cold things that have happened to you which is truly the opposite of what you should have thought. but nothing I write in a reddit comment is going to cure you.

the comment that the person replying to was replying to, is the only condition that is mandatory in order for someone to cheat. all other answers are things that cheaters will sometimes tack on as something that pushed them to do it.

hayley I love you and I am sorry for every time I ever was upset with you for getting back together with wyatt. I had no idea you were being manipulated in such a twisted way

well i am worried at this point about whether sam you may have so much influence over hayley that they never speak to anybody else who went to our school or verify our age. and in that situation the hardest thing i will ever have to do is to walk away from this situation knowing what i know, that hayley thinks their emotional abuser is their best friend, and that there is absolutely nothing i can do about it.

when me and hayley were friends, they made it very obvious without being prompted to that they were happier in our friendship than they were with you, sam. me and hayley both felt a kind of happiness that was different from things we felt before.

at this point i have figured out that is because me and hayley are the first people in the others life to truly care for the other without having a desire to control the other.

you are so heartless that you convinced hayley the feeling of being loved while being free, was really a feeling they by recreating their csa.

if i have to walk away from this without them ever finding out the truth, that will be the hardest thing ive ever had to do

i have just been frozen staring into space in shock right now. you constructed an elaborate trick that would be sure to convince hayley they cannot trust their own self. the effect this would have on them is extremely predictable and so i am sure you did it on purpose. this is so many levels o fucked up. you are such a cold and miserable fucking person sam.

sam, holy shit. what i am describing right now. it has a name.

munchausen by proxy, when you convince someone they have an imaginary illness for which they need to depend on you for. in this case, the imaginary illness is a mental one. a non-existent one, where people who were victims of pedophilia grow up to be attracted to pedophiles. sam you are such a horrible person i dont even know what to say. its so many levels of horrible. i am just, holy shit this makes me feel so sad. and scared for hayley, because this is a level of emotional abuse i never knew existed. you really thought this out. and you really did not give a single fuck.

hayley i would encourage you verify my age as quickly as you can and in the meantime please keep a distance from sam. she is not a safe person she is abusive and i have no clue what her limits may or may not be

sam i am sad because the fact this is. what it is,,

did you come up with this idea because hayley told you about james' mom, and you decided to,,,,try it?

i feel sick right now

sam holy shit, you threaten hayley daily, you separated us by convincing them they fell in love with a pedophile. that they unknowingly recreated their csa trauma by choice.

do you understand, how fucking disturbing that is? i cannot even imaging how hayley has felt this whole time. nothing like that would ever happen which is the reason i am just going to say it: if i were in hayley's shoes the things you have convinced them of would make me feel actually disgusted with myself. i would feel like i cannot trust my own likes and dislikes, and i would feel like i cannot trust a single thought in my mind or choice i wanted to make. that my own instincts exist to sabotage me.

this is psychopathic, and i am realizing while im writing how you have acquired so much control and leverage over hayley. the more i write the more i slow down and think about what i am saying

you are a monster. and you are talking about the moral character of others right now?

this is so unreal

I could've spent a lifetime before my life trying to predict what would happen in it, and I never would have thought of something like this

it is so batshit. sam the first time we ever had any significant interaction was on the 6th grade camping trip. then we were in the same class for two years. now, this person who I never thought would be of any importance to my life, has told the love of my life that not only did we not go to school together, but that I am as old as my own dad

username. just, the username. I never seen anything like it.

It is absurd, hilarious, and terrifying. It's terrifying because you are comfortable with controlling hayley, by instilling a sense of existential panic in them. you know that I am twenty years old for a fact. you know that hayley would not be in any danger doing the things they want to do. but you are happiest when your best friend is too terrified to get away from you

what the fuck

this is so transphobic sam

stop suggesting terrible concepts to Hayley

this is not how dysphoria works at fucking all. I hate every single thing about being trans. everything 

you are such a shit person. I don't think about my gender sam. literally ever, because I'm a normal goddamn person 

the whole reason I transitioned was because I wanted to stop having to think about my gender. I was forced to bc of dysphoria 

I am just trying to live my goddamn life without being miserable. what the fuck is your problem with that? what is wrong with you. you are irl transphobic, you are also irl dumb as fuck and I think the two are connected because the amount of difficulty you have in processing that it's not a fucking choice

when the fuck have I ever talked about my the fact I'm a girl. who cares. who fucking cares. you are the only one who goddamn cares so I'm begging you to stop suggesting this disgusting shit is a nightmare depiction of trans people you are such a shit ass person. I transitioned because the other option was BEING MISERABLE FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE

you are the OPPOSITE. OF. AN ALLY. you are the most transphobic person I have ever fucking met. not only that but you are irl sexist , what the fuck in you says that anyone on this whole goddamn earth would think to themselves "I like being female !!!" what the fuck. who the fuck thinks about their gender or anyone's gender that way in the first place. but for anyone to say they like being female is goddamn insane

you are SO FUCKING TRANSPHOBIC FOR SAYING THAT SOMEONE WOULD TAKE ESTROGEN BECAUSE THEY "LIKE BEING FEMALE" OR WOULD TRANSITION BECAUSE THEY "LIKE BEING FEMALE" you are so fucking transphobic for suggesting anyone in this whole world would do that

I haven't even looked at this person's profile

their username is pretentious, their answer is pretentious 

there is nothing smart about this answer, it causes you to roll your eyes because it's not an answer to what the user actually asked. everyone knows what the question is actually trying to say, purposefully misinterpreting it and answering a different question "what do you wish didn't exist-&gt;cancer," is not anything other than annoying.

I don't know why you think I am trying to give answers to things that I think sound smart. I am not.

I think that this is another thing where you feeling the need to write crap like this, says you're thinking the opposite. pretentious crap is so hard to read, you just roll your eyes. if you and Hayley were rolling your eyes at the things I say or do, you wouldn't have to post these things to try and trick them

you should stop being so specific. you have a pattern of showing what you truly think by emphasizing the traits you most want to minimize about me. the other day you were writing things that would trick like, little kids. when I turned that around on you and said you were over shooting it and nobody would fall for that, you turn around and go for a different angle and start writing pretentious things.

I read what you write now, and it's all just compliments to me. you make me feel like a main character. I have a feeling you want exactly the opposite. in bojack there's a quote called "the movie start speech."

“Okay. Carolyn, you are the star of a movie. This is the part of the movie where you get your heart broken. Where the world tests you, and people treat you like shit. But it has to happen this way. Otherwise, the end of the movie, when you get everything you want, won’t feel as rewarding. There are assholes out there, but in the end, they don’t matter. Because this movie’s not about them. It’s never been about them.”

“All this time, the movie’s been about you.”

you are making me feel as though me and hayley are reaching the end of the movie and it's been about us

sam you stigmatize mental health problems like crazy

i know you struggle with these things. why are you so ashamed of it? when i talk about how you told me you wanted to kill yourself when you have to see your mom, i feel bad for you. and i felt bad for you when you told me then.

what do you feel when i talk about it? it feels like you have this idea like someone having a thought like this one "i feel like i dont matter" that it somehow an embarrassing thing. i dont understand that. but i wonder if the fact you think that way is why you never got help

wtf

sam what is wrong with you. why do you hate hayley so much. you do. you hate them. this is the opposite of love. the exact opposite

you are triyng to put them in a prison of fear and self doubt. you lie to them to separate us and when thats not enough to keep them away because your lies make no sense and they can tell youre gaslighting them, you instill paranoia and self doubt that comes from absolutely nowhere.

sam what the fuck about me breaking up with morrigan because they suicide baited me, then me losing interest in them and deciding not to get back together with them shortly after meeting hayley, says the title of this post to you

hayley knows that you know i am a lesbian. you have figured that out by now. there must be so much passive aggression during interactions with you two its insane.

this is not protection. if you had known about something like this, you would be warning them

you are like creating imaginary scenarios that would make them insecure and even in some cases frighten hayley, in what world is telling your friend imaginary but terrifying scenarios, helping them or protecting them. in what world sam

you are committed this. your reputation depends on it. you dont give a single fuck, and the amount that hayley is willing to bottle up in this situation, you are going to take advantage of until the very end. hayley you already know whats going on. both of us are worried about sam. i am gonna stop commenting, weve done all of this enough...on monday, my therapist will confirm my legal name and gender change and that my birthday is exactly the same as sams, same day same year, because we went to the same school together. sam started school there around like 2nd or 3rd grade if i recall right. all i know is she was not in our kindergarten class. i was never held back, in fact i completed high school younger than sam did.

presumably this information will tell you that sam is a liar...sam, please, go to sleep. if what im saying about my therapist does not happen, yall can just never speak to me again, genuinely, it would mean for a fact i were a liar/gaslighter. nobody cares if need to stop posting sam, monday is the day where hayley finds out if theyre waiting on reina, or if they were waiting on paul.

sam , saying something that does not make any sense , is not a joke. 90% of the "jokes" you make on here are like that because you are too sleep deprived to actually construct a joke. they are not jokes because you could generate infinite of them using a random word generator. random adjective for the question, random noun for every "joke" response.

hey sam when is the rest time you had a glass of water ? d
how much sleep did you get last night ? did you know that you need to sleep contiguously for the sleep to count the same way ? every time you wake up your body starts over your sleep cycle from the beginning. you should get a sleep tracker on your phone and look at how bad it is. you don't reach most of the important cycles of sleep that you need for your mind to wake up at a consistent baseline state. throughout the day all of the specific activity in your brain is causing specific receptors to be downregulated, to adjust to whatever that day brought. you need to go to sleep because you need a long contiguous period of time without activity in your brain where you can actually let all of the neurons in your brain go back to a baseline for the next day. you think you outsmarted the schedule of the entire world by taking frequent naps, you seriously have not, and it is actually showing in your behavior. hayley has noticed it too they upvoted my comments about you needing sleep twice now.

you are like my enemy but I'm weirdly concerned for your health. and I'm concerned about the fact this situation is pushing you so so hard, you're truly trying to push yourself to the edge of your mental limits and to the edge of the capacity of your body....sam I responded to one of your catfishes saying they were gonna kill themself as though it was you just saying it just to be snarky that I knew it was you, but seriously what is happening.you are a liar so you know the chances that I'm lying about my old therapist are essentially zero. aren't you exhausted ? why don't you just confess ? what is at stake for you right now ? the things you suggest I would do, like trap hayley, is something I never would do but you have proven you would do. and I am worried about what else you would do. can you please just tell hayley what's going on ? I feel like some part of you must really want to just so this can all finally be over...that's why I wrote that I am actually concerned about your safety because you're acting as though your life is at stake. neither me nor Hayley have pushed ourselves this much for this situation. and we are the ones who are in love w each other

hayley I am always here for you if you need to call me, and I love you

sam there are way too many different sub circles of "programming" for this type of catfish to ever be effective 

there are no subreddits about the kind of development I do because I don't do one "kind" of development I don't enjoy doing that I like to think of problems that I have to come up with a brand new solution for 

the type of stuff you'll find looking up "what do programmers post on the internet" is gonna be all about specific web development frameworks and shit like that. a project I would be more interested in would be, developing a new web development framework, which I am currently doing actually 

good luck though...

stop trying to trick hayley, you've now spent as much time on reddit as I have added up (holy shit the demonstration of your insanity in that sentence is unbelievable) we both know nobody gives a single fuck to take their time out of their day to write "what?" to a comment they don't understand , let alone not even a person who replied to them, because what the fuck could that possibly gain someone 

you know this, I know this, you are a shitty person, stop trying to gaslight your friend

I love how when I pointed out that feeling the need to downvote the comments you don't like how they read untouched is only embarrassing yourself, you just started embarrassing yourself even more

sam you know nothing about reddit, or about programming. why do you think someone would write a bot to do...this

there are no bots like you're talking about on reddit

I think are used to allllll the way back when you very first started doing this, where comments like this would upset me. now, they are dead giveaways of who I am talking to , because only you act this much like a troll 

it really is main character syndrome irl. Sam you have dedicated your life to *trolling me*. literally. that's what you waste all of your time and energy on

I feel like the belle of the ball...

sam I am concerned for you because the fact you think you can trick hayley into believing that comment was "plausibly a real person" shows that you are genuinely and actually not thinking straight. everyone, hears a funnier joke than that, every single day, actually

hayley are you okay ? I am just like. Sam is a deeply bad person and I am so, I just yeah reading this gives me the creeps. she's not holding a gun to your head but she is purposefully trying to make you feel afraid for your safety and life as a direct attempt to control you.

sam can you shut the fuck up ? I'm trying to fall asleep. you don't need to keep replying to me to ask teen boys

you are not thinking rationally bc you haven't been sleeping. the fact you started replying to me over and over and over again tonight, after taking a break from behaving that way for like a week. I had been commenting this whole entire day, without you responding to literally anything. now all of a sudden this.

it's like damn, at this rate, you might not even have till Monday morning.

this is suspicious, it's really suspicious that I'm commenting after I said goodnight to Hayley don't you think ? don't go to sleep for hours, if I stop making comments it's probably just a cover, I'm probably still awake and just waiting for you to go to sleep so I can start asking the teen boys my own questions. you need to be suspicious. do not ever go to sleep sam

you are screwed come monday morning.

and hayley im writing this despite that hopefully nothing I wrote will ever end up mattering whatsoever but it's also relevant just to say that all of the trauma you have had from people who were drunk, were already capable of those things in a way most people are not and ik that because there is no intoxication on anything that would cause me to be abusive

stop future faking, you know just as well as I do that my hobbies are real. you are a gaslighter, you were on my ig and you saw me play weak when ur around, me and ur ghost and other songs on my guitar. you saw me play original songs I wrote when I was 15 on my ukulele. and then told hayley I must have tricked them (tricked them??? again sam you are stupid, these things, are impossible) into thinking I played the guitar. you couldn't even bare to admit that you knew I had a quality as simple as playing the guitar

I am so confused. Sam , are you trying to trash talk me by suggesting I used to be poor  ? what is wrong with you. you think it's embarrassing to be poor ? you are seriously such a disgusting person.

regardless, you would be wrong, I've always been privileged? but seriously, why on earth would you think hayley would think growing up poor is an ick. they're not a horrible person like you

sam you are back to suggesting that a man would transition to become a woman because you apparently believe being dependent on a man is a good thing that is desirable and people pretend to be women in order to achieve that. why do you think people want that?

you are such a fucking terf it's so nightmarish holy shit

edit: also did you just start trying to highlight the fact I'm unemployed, directly after I made a commit to the project im working on in my free time ? do the things I spend my time on make you feel insecure about how you spend your time (hand creating spam on reddit) ? sam there are so many things I feel like you show jealousy about, and you spend a thousand times as much energy on your jealousy of those things as I ever had to spend to accomplish them. getting good at songwriting is actually an extremely believable thing. you just don't believe in yourself. and when you see these things you think to yourself that you could never do the same. which is not even true, you spend more energy trying to invalidate my good qualities than it would take for you to have those qualities

what is wrong with you, you are not a fucking idiot, you know a pedophile would not take you to the place they are trying to groom children. so this is just, you, wanting to ask a bunch of young teen boys if cute or hot is better

Sam are you actually a pedophile ? this shit has gotten so fucking weird, and you won't let it go, it's like you wanted an excuse to be disgusting towards young boys. there is no fucking excuse

sam you are such a gaslighter.you tried to convince hayley that morrigan was a young boy. they are less than a month younger than me. what is wrong with you. who the fuck makes up false accusations of pedophilia. if you were going to do that you could have at least tried, morrigan is a person you can find them in an online phone book I'll put their last name in the drive in a second. again this is what makes me say you are just straight up dumb. who , literally who comes up with such a shitty impulsive lie like that. and the fact you are creeping out real life young boys knowingly for zero reason whatsoever is fucking disgusting

sam what is happening. the concept of being attracted to parenthood is inherently disgusting and that's the only reason I can possibly understand why you constantly write about it. can I make something very clear, my sister is a professional babysitter and she works full time, my mom is a literal registered nurse who works with premature infants on the verge of death which I really don't think is even close to the picture you paint when you talk about these types of things, the connection you made to my mom and sister's gender is purely your own sexism. I don't know what on earth that would even have to do with being attracted to parenthood? sam that is disgusting. again you are like freud if you took out everything valuable and left just the disgustingness and sexism.

can we go back several months rn. bc I feel like you made a really sexist assumption. you once wrote to me from an account talking about how an ai told you that "men tend to think more rationally, where as women tend to be more nurturing" and holy shit I could not have wanted to vomit faster. later I remembered something I had said a few days ago and it made me really sad that the person who I thought was doing all this at the time, hayley, would have made this awful assumption. you were writing some transphobic garbage that was obviously implying that if you were "raised male" you are fundamentally different from cis girls and you are invalid. that shit is beyond transphobic. I quoted a study that found on brain imaging scans that certain physical characteristics of your brain are differentiated by gender but that they found trans people's brains had more similar brains to the cis people of the gender they are, than to the brains of people of their assigned gender at birth. one of the main differences that they used to tell apart between the genders are the complexity and number of connections between the two hemispheres of your brain

you could've looked it up. you are too sexist, and you assumed that I thought something in reality, you clearly think. otherwise you would have maybe considered the possibility women have more connections between their brain hemispheres than men. which is the case....you did not even care to look it up which suggests you thought you already knew the answer...why did you think it was impossible that women might have more than men ?

what?

sam you have to be making a joke

it's an app. it's not oxygen?

I spent the entire summer of 2019 in hospitals and residential. they don't let you have phones, or even books that are interesting because they can't reference anything remotely rated r. but yes I can't live without reddit /s

actually this is not a joke this is another projection (this time I'm being kind of silly though) sam you can't live without reddit. it is like oxygen to you because it's the one thing keeping hayley from confirming for a fact that you are the horrible person they have suspicions you are.

have you noticed that the only reason I use reddit anymore is to point out how ass your content is ? I do miss how reddit was before you started posting all the time ...I actually like reddit a lot because of the separations by subreddit. I feel like you constantly write weird things like "im reddit virgin #2747363 haha 😎" and it's like,,,I never saw anyone make such a joke about the fact they use reddit until you started making catfishes that did. I feel like you tend to take very insignificant traits about me, and then make up a characterization of said trait that does not even exist , and write people self identifying said connection that does not even exist.

this app has r/ihavesex but the content you make would be r/idonthavesex. holy fuck we get the point sam. the funniest part about all of this was that your personality used to be r/idonthavesex, and you didn't have sex until you were older than both me and hayley... and I only point that out to say me and hayley weren't mocking you for saying that kind of crap because nobody cares other than you,which is clear by the things you write

I don't understand how you keep a straight face while claiming I have a secret reddit account. and I am seriously thinking I should be spending *my* energy looking for your secret tumblr account which I actually know exists. can I ask you a question Sam

could you even live without Tumblr?

false

Sam you stigmatize mental health problems a shocking amount. you also don't understand them. having mental health problems mean you very much notice the difference between the way you struggle and the way the rest of the world does. since when was everyone secretly mentally ill

Sam I think this is just you projecting your denial of your obvious mental health problems as suggesting that people with mental health problems just don't understand that everyone is struggling that way and they just deal with it. no sam, you are dealing with something that the vast majority of people don't struggle with, and you need help with it

holy shit that is so unfunny

sam rhyming isn't joking? again I called hayley unprecedentedly pretty and it made your ears bleed. Sam you are so predictable. I think I'm really starting to understand you. it's all like paul thing. "oh god shut up shut up shut up." everything you say as gaslighting to Hayley, the difference between what actually happened and what you came up with, is so funny and embarrassing as to why you felt the need to do all of this. you hate the story of how I met Hayley just as much as you hate how pretty they are. when I called hayley unprecedentedly pretty you could not bear it.

now here's all this stuff I never said. sam, it is painful the way you reply to these and call yourself clever. the most embarrassing part is that you actually spent time coming up with this. when did I rhyme two things and pass it off as a joke? also, again have you lived in the real world ? a joke like that is something you would hear in like an instructional video or something and would not cause anyone on earth to do more than politely chuckle...

you know I actually was instilled a sense of "be strong, be independent, don't ask for help from anybody do everything yourself," by my mom. my mom constantly tried highlight the value of independence. she mostly did so as an excuse to neglect us

I was taught to never ask for help as a kid. but not by my dad, he was constantly begging us to ask for things because my mom had us trained the opposite way.

so maybe you picked up on that. then, sam-vision took hold and you said "I know this stereotype, Reina most have a dad with insecure masculinity, and she must think she is being manly by not wanting to ask for help. this is clearly insecure masculinity" she says about the traits I picked up from my mom

I think the only reason you ever suggested anything regarding "insecure masculinity " was as a weird excuse to assume I am hiding a secretive personality...

what is happening

sam please stop gaslighting hayley I don't know why you hate me so much I could pick anything you tried to say about me here and it would be so much worse than anything I ever said about you or did to you. I care about Hayley so much I swear please just stop please I hate you so much

sam spending hours thinking of her best re-wordings of "what's your dirtiest secret that would make everybody see you differently"

this question is slightly broader though. this isn't a secret it's just something i can't really talk about. bc I don't wanna talk dirty to a wall, tbh. that is one of the many reasons you want to keep me and Hayley from communicating. but my actual answer to this is sex w hayley 

can I just say that the answers you wrote are just. Sam can we make a rule ? if you're supposedly trying to find my "secret account" then shouldn't you be posting about things related to things I said ? how about you can only do that.can you please explain to me how "finances" are related to anything I have ever expressed an interest in ? also, who the fuck , other than accountants, think about finances every single day ? I feel like the further this goes on, you have gotten less and less and less realistic. it's kind of insulting. to both me and hayley. I don't know what lies you told them to make them afraid to talk to me but sooner or later they are going to realize everything you say about me is malicious...

you are hella manipulative.this came from nowhere, other than you randomly suggesting things that you know would make hayley feel insecure. I lost feelings for morrigan very shortly after I broke up with them. morrigan took testosterone and grew facial hair and now I am not even attracted to them physically bc I'm a lesbian.

also you are gaslighting hayley to suggest I would fucking *ever* tell someone I love them while , writing crap like this on reddit??? what the fuck sam . you don't have dementia you know who I am

also why the fuck, why, why, why, why, literally WHY do all of your avatars have beards and mustaches and shit ??? since when the FUCK have I had facial hair that shit makes me feel dysphoric as fuck and makes me want to vomit at the thought of it

it is just so damn unnecessary and I told you I dislike it but you hate me

yikes. well I was talking to hayley and you decided to intrude on my conversation and apply your icky world view to what I was talking about. the last time I cooked was when I cooked either for or with morrigan when they would come over or I would go to their house. I don't mind cooking for other people...more importantly, nothing on this entire thread that you have written applies to me. literally not a single one out of everything you wrote...I don't even know that this is gaslighting so much as it is your real life icky stereotype-locked world view

actually there is one. I do like bubbles. but not because they make me feel like a child. because they're bubbles. holy fuck sam let people enjoy things

when did I talk about personality tests ? that sounds like something you would be more interested in sam, because you like to perceive the world in terms of static labels and stereotypes 

hayley, she couldn't be more inauthentic. if you were gonna help your friend catfish someone would you do it by talking about things they have never said anything remotely related to before?

also, sam you are so weirdly obsessed with putting anime everywhere. I can tell you think anime is cringey. but is that like a personality trait of yours ? bc I have never watched anime in my life so that's only coming from you

sam I am twenty years old

what is even happening right now. there is no such thing as a twenty year old who would tell their younger self that. I am not even interpreting this from a pov other than you don't even suggest things that make any sense, that's how I know for a fact the only condition they meet is "gives you a visceral reaction while you read it"

if this is supposed to be your jump from me saying I tried to kill myself because of my bpd, sam, you aren't dumb, that's not even close to what I wrote. I wrote that I wanted to kill myself since I knew suicide was a possibility, and tried many many times, then I met Hayley, and the next time I tried to kill myself again was after I thought I wouldn't know Hayley anymore. that is not very hard to understand. "severely suicidal person was suicidal most of the time except for the best times of her life she's ever been in." one of your disgusting characters is just like an impersonation of ted mosby. read the username please

oh there's a hotel nearby. I bet somebody probably was planning on meeting up to have sex with a prostitute to cheat, and then when the prostitute didn't show, they were sooooo so so upset that they ran their car into a wall

the maryland school for the deaf is suspiciously close by. they offer public education at no cost to deaf people.now what if. you don't think. that somebody who wasn't deaf, might end up pretending to be in order to get a free education, do you ? because that seems exactly like the kind of person that would be spending their extra saved up money on prostitutes, and crashing their cars into walls. I think the police should be questioning if this person was a student there. if so, they should be interrogating them to try and figure out whether or not they're truly deaf. but oh no, the only way to find out for a fact is to read their mind. oh fuck

I could probably do a better job if I actually knew anything about this situation

i have an extremely serious answer to this question

disturbed.

sam, you just dont give a fuck. you truly do not give a single fuck, from the very beginning, you did not give a fuck. everything you post, is so blatantly. gaslighting. its insane. there is no such thing as someone being as delusional as you act like you are. you make every piece of content you create with a single intent: "im trying to trick my best friend." its so bad. its just so so bad. sometimes thinking about it all at once is just so fucking overwhelming, like how could just truly, not give a single fuck. its so horrible, and the number of times i do this, i already know you turn every feeling of guilt around into a motivation to keep Hayley from finding out how horrible of a person you truly are. i am so so sorry for whatever fucked up mind games your mom played on you as a kid. i dont even know what to say right now thinking about it, its like obviously nothing i write in a reddit comment is gonna change you as a person. and i just feel fucking bad for you sometimes. but holy shit the blatant emotional abuse. i only feel bad for you because i am a secondary victim to Hayley. it so callous the way you just know, exactly what you are fucking doing, and you are fully committed to it.

your whole thing makes no sense. you say i somehow have no trauma, never been through a damn thing in my life apparently according to the comment im replying to, and also at the same time am an evil genius mastermind trickster with manipulation skills so good they are somehow magical and change hayley's perception of reality.

like the outlandishness , its just so ridiculous. not only would i never say something like that, someone who was on the level of shitty to say something like that, it wouldnt make any fucking sense for it to be in this type of way? as a blatantly callous sentence that no one in the whole world would think is funny, or would think even comes across as intending to be funny, as the first response to a post like this. you are so horrible at this but you also dont try

there is a 99.9% chance you are sam. reddit has karma and account ages for a reason and your threads have all users with lower ones than any normal thread on any subreddit you dont post in, which is a fuck ton, and its painfully obvious which ones you do and dont. this whole thing is so deeply flawed and i dont know why hayley hasnt called you out on the fact you are clearly just trying to keep us apart because youre probably a liar

i dont know sam but for you the answer is "she called me annoying, because the person i hold closest to in my life said it first, and now im not gonna use that fact to not help the closest person in my life communicate with her"

i have no idea what youre talking about sam. i guess you picked up on the fact i sometimes go on wikipedia rabbit holes? firstly you have zero clue what im interested in, and there are way too many things to learn about for you to be like "i bet reina learned about this."

i do love seeing these posts because the irony in knowing you are learning all about these things is very funny

sam i am traumatized and my circles tend to include other traumatized people, and i get along well w other traumatized people. the fact i fell in love with two traumatized people is not a coincidence, it is bc im also traumatized and originally connected w both of those people by relating about that. hayley only loving me because i love them is actually one of my worst fears....the reason i said the thought that hayley wants to be loved and i want to love them but all we can do is hurt each other makes me wanna die is because it hurts the most to see the person you love the most unhappy.
